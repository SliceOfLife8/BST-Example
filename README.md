# BST-Example
Basic example of BST whereas someone can test insert, delete and search a node.

## Basic implementation
In **Contents.swift** file we are creating a binaryTree based on random integers of a specific range and a standard binaryTree based on predefined values. 
In these trees we are searching for some *element* of the list. 
The result it should be a new subBinaryTree based on *element*.
